The application represents a retail cash register.

The software system is developed in Java, within the NetBeans 15 environment, and designed as a desktop client-server application. The system is divided into three projects: Server, Client, and Shared.

It is required that the cashier logs in from the client side using a username and password to access the program and its functionalities.

After logging in, the main form appears, from which the basic functionalities can be accessed:

1. Creating an invoice
2. Viewing invoices
3. Editing and deleting invoices
4. Invoice payment
